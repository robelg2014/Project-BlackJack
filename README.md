# black jack:
 the game draws two cards for each player 
you want your card to add up to as close to 21 as possible.
if you do no reach 21 on the first 'round' with your first two cards you can 'hit' and get another card to add to the two you have.
if you go over 21 you lose . 
the player closes to 21 wins.
*  the game will have a deck of cards 
this will be two arrays 
i will loop through these arrays at random to get a card 
*  i will make two players 
these players will take turns till someone hits 21 or doesn't want another card 
* the dealer also doesn't hit at 17
